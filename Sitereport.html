			<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
			<p>This report presents the result of the 1st term assignment of web development. I started to learn HTML when I was in grade 8 to 9. In my school days my knowledge of HTML was very basic and low interms of what i have learn in recent months. I enrolled the college one month later although I don't have as much experience as other student, but still online revision classes which was held by our very own module leader Mr. Ankit Thapa was great help for me. He has been kind, selfless during this period taking some time off for new student and giving us some extra class helping us out with some decision of assignment has been a great help for us.<br>
			Meanwhile the selection of background image  was done from my owm photography carefully so that the image was neither light nor dark, for making the pages look more insteresting use of different creative colors of linear gradient can be seen, the color of hover effect with crimson color , section partation in contact page, placeholder image in portofolio, etc all of the inspiration I have got from different sites, research, own creativeness and from the notes, mentorship of my module which has been huge support in building an successful page. To apperciations the help of sites references  will be mentioned and referred in respective pages. To link the pages menu bar can be seen which is constant in all the pages so that we can easily access any  pages.<br> 
			In process of making pages, pushing files, creating branches in Github. I had many errors and problems like  in responsive view of portfolio zoom in effect was seen,  branches were not merging, due to deletion of Readme.md file from PC cloning and pushing of file was completely blocked. Due to adding many image at since i had to delete whole image once at a time, creation and deletion of branches can be seen frequently, background image was not covering the background. All the process, error, validation design ideas, reference has all been descride in brief down below.  
			</p><br>
			<h4>OBJECTIVES</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>To learn about the basics of html and css</li>
					<li>To create or script any web page through the coding.</li>
					<li>To simplify data and knowledge with amended ability to show pictures, links, other files, etc </li>
					<li>To structure and present information via internet.</li>
			    </ul><br>
			<h4>OBSERVATION</h4>
			<p>During working and building the webpage which was given as an assignment I have noticed various errors and changes, with some related researches and studies i was able to make my very own first webpage. Errors, changes and refereneces for the apperciations has been mentioned in respective pages below:
			</p><br>
			<ol>
				<li>INDEX</li>
				Homepage is the first page of webpage. Here I represent some simple ideas and creativeness like placing logo with own image at the left hand side, background image has been used which I have self photographed, small message in between the page with some twist of colors has been used, hovering effect etc. The idea of logo and font color from different site form the different research which will .<br>
