			<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
			<p>This report presents the result of the 1st term assignment of web development. I started to learn about HTML when I was in class 8. In my school days my knowledge of HTML was low. I enrolled the college one month later although I don't have as much experience as other student, but still online revision classes which was held by our very own module leader Mr. Ankit Thapa. He has been kind, selfless during this period taking some time off for new student and giving us some extra class helping us out with some decision of assignment has been a great help for us.</p><br>
			<h4>OBJECTIVES</h4>
			<li>To learn about the basics of html and css</li>
			<li>To create or script any web page through the coding.</li>
			<li>To simplify data and knowledge with amended ability to show pictures, links, other files, etc </li>
			<li>To structure and present information via internet.</li><br>
			<h4>OBSERVATION</h4>
			<p>During working and building the webpage which was given as an assignment I have noticed various errors and changes, with some related researches and studies i was able to make my very own first webpage. Errors, changes and referneces for the apperciations has been mentioned in respective pages below:

Here i represent some simple ideas and creativeness like placing logo with own image at the left hand side, background image has been used which i have self photographed, font size with some twist of colors has been used, etc. I got this idea of logo and font from different site form the different research.</p><br>
