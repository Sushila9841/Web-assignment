			During this pandemic everyone has suffered a lot every business, office, school, etc  where closed and had to suffer from the loss. But during this time period IT sector was growing more. So in this period I thought  why not IT because I was interested in computer since my childhood. I wanted to do something in this field. I have seen very few female are involved in it so it is also one of the reason I choose It in bachelors. The increasing demand of the IT and the interest, creativeness, and the passion I have got in the field has lead me to study in this field.</p>
