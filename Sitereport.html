			<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
			<p>I started to learn about HTML when i was in class 8. In my school days my knowledge of HTML were low. I enrolled the college one month later although i don't have as much experience as other student. but still online revision classes which was held by our very own module leader Mr. Ankit Thapa. He has been kind, selfless during this period taking some time off for new student and giving us some extra class helping us out with some decision of assignment has been a great help for us.</p>
			<h4>OBJECTIVES</h4>
			<li>To learn about the basics of html and css</li>
			<li>To create or script any web page through the coding.</li>
			<li>To simplify data and knowledge with amended ability to show pictures, links, other files, etc </li>
			<li>To structure and present information via internet.</li><br>
			<h4>OBSERVATION</h4>
			<p>During working and building the webpage which was given as an assignment i have noticed various errors. with some related researches and studies i was able to make my very own first webpage. Errors has been mentioned below:

	  x.className += " responsive";
	} else {
	  x.className = "navbar";
	}
}
